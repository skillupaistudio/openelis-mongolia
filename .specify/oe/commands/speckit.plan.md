If any guidance conflicts with the core SpecKit command, follow this section.

- Use `.specify/memory/constitution.md` as the authoritative constitution
  source.
- Use `.specify/guides/testing-roadmap.md` for testing requirements and
  references.
- Use `.specify/scripts/...` paths for scripts (setup-plan,
  update-agent-context).
- Constitution Principle IX applies: include a Milestone Plan when the effort is
  expected to exceed 3 days.
- The Milestone Plan must include milestone IDs, branch suffixes, scope, user
  stories, verification criteria, and dependencies.
- Include a Mermaid dependency graph for milestones and mark parallel milestones
  with `[P]`.
- The plan must include a Testing Strategy section that references the Testing
  Roadmap and covers coverage goals, test types, test data management, and
  checkpoint validations.
